## About

This repository is a collection of algorithm implementations in different programming languages. The goal is to provide a comprehensive reference for students, developers, and enthusiasts who are looking to understand how various algorithms work under the hood.

## Algorithms

Here are some of the algorithm categories covered in this repository:

- **Sorting Algorithms**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- **Searching Algorithms**
  - Binary Search
  - Linear Search
- **Dynamic Programming**
  - Fibonacci Sequence
  - Knapsack Problem
- **Graph Algorithms**
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
- **Other Algorithms**
  - Divide and Conquer
  - Backtracking

Each algorithm is accompanied by an explanation of its working, time complexity, and a step-by-step implementation guide.

## Installation

To clone this repository, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yossef-ashraf/Algorithm-Implementation.git
```

Navigate to the directory:
