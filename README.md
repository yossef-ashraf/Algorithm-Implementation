# Quick Sort and Fibonacci using Dynamic Programming

## Project Description

This project aims to provide solutions to two common problems in computer science using the PHP programming language:

1. **Quick Sort:**
 The project includes implementing the quick sort algorithm in two ways:
 - **Recursive:** It depends on calling the function itself to divide the array into smaller parts.
 - **Non-Iterative:** It uses a stack to manage subsections instead of iterative calls.

2. **Fibonacci series using Dynamic Programming:**
 - Fibonacci numbers are calculated dynamically to avoid repetitive calculations and improve performance.

## Objectives

- **Performance improvement:** Through the use of dynamic programming and reducing repetitive calls in quick sort.
- **Education and clarification:** Providing practical examples of using these two algorithms in programming.

## Requirements

- PHP 7.0 or higher.
